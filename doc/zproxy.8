.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
RELIANOID
.B zproxy
is a high-performance multithreaded and event-driven L7 reverse proxy and load
balancer inspired by Pound reverse proxy simplicity.
.PP
The
.B zproxy
main features include HTTP/HTTPS handling, Pound load balancer configuration
file compatibility, managed by REST API requests in JSON format, load balancing
algorithms (Round Robin, Least Connections, Response Time, Pending Connections),
connection pinning, and backend output traffic marking.
.SH GENERAL PRINCIPLES
.P
In general
.B zproxy
needs three types of objects defined in order to function:
.IR listeners ,
.I services
and
.IR back-ends .
.TP
\fBListeners\fR
A
.I listener
is a definition of how
.B zproxy
receives requests from the clients (browsers). Two types of
.I listeners
may be defined: regular HTTP
.I listeners
and HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS)
.IR listeners .
At the very least a
.I listener
must define the address and port to listen on, with additional
requirements for HTTPS
.IR listeners .
.TP
\fBServices\fR
A
.I service
is the definition of how the requests are answered. The
.I services
may be defined within a
.I listener
or at the top level (global). When a request is received
.B zproxy
attempts to match them to each
.I service
in turn, starting with the
.I services
defined in the
.I listener
itself and, if needed, continuing with the
.I services
defined at the global level. The
.I services
may define their own conditions as to which requests they can answer:
typically this involves certain URLs (images only, or a certain path)
or specific headers (such as the Host header). A
.I service
may also define a
.I session
mechanism: if defined future requests from a given client will always
be answered by the same
.IR back-end .
.TP
\fBBack-ends\fR
The
.I back-ends
are the actual servers for the content requested. By itself,
.B zproxy
supplies no responses - all contents must be received from a "real"
web server. The
.I back-end
defines how the server should be contacted.
.IP
Three types of
.I back-ends
may be defined: a "regular"
.I back-end
which receives requests and returns responses, a "redirect"
.I back-end
in which case
.B zproxy
will respond with a redirect response, without accessing any
.I back-end
at all, or an "emergency"
.I back-end
which will be used only if all other backends are "dead".
.IP
Multiple
.I back-ends
may be defined within a
.IR service ,
in which case
.B zproxy
will load-balance between the available
.IR back-ends .
.IP
If a
.I back-end
fails to respond it will be considered "dead", in which case
.B zproxy
will stop sending requests to it. Dead
.I back-ends
are periodically checked for availability, and once they respond again they
are "resurected" and requests are sent again their way. If no
.I back-ends
are available (none were defined, or all are "dead") then
.B zproxy
will reply with "503 Service Unavailable", without checking additional
.IR services .
.IP
The connection between
.B zproxy
and the
.I back-ends
is always via HTTP(S), regardless of the actual protocol used between
.B zproxy
and the client.
.SH OPTIONS
Options available (see also below for configuration file options):
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-disable\-daemon\fR
Disable the daemon mode. This option overwrites the config file directive.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sync\fR
Enable session synchronization.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-file\fR \fIconfig_file\fR
Location of the configuration file (see below for a full description of the format).
Default:
.I /usr/local/etc/zproxy.cfg
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-pid\fR \fIpid_file\fR
Location of the pid file.
.B zproxy
will write its own pid into this file. Normally this is used for shell
scripts that control starting and stopping of the daemon.
Default:
.I /var/run/zproxy.pid
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-check\fR
Check only:
.B zproxy
will exit immediately after parsing the configuration file. This may be used for
running a quick syntax check before actually activating a server.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-log\fR \fIlevel\fR
Set the syslog level.
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-log\-output\fR \fI
Set the daemon logs output: 0 syslog (default), 1 stdout, 2 stderr.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show help information.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version:
.B zproxy
will exit immediately after printing the current version and configuration flags.
.PP
In general, any number of back-end servers may be specified. Use the priority to
affect the load distribution among unequally performing servers.
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE"
Each line in the file is considered a complete configuration directive. The directives
are case-insensitive. Empty lines or lines starting in '#' are ignored. There are three
types of directives:
.B global
directives (they affect the settings for the entire program instance),
.B listener
directives (they define which requests
.B zproxy
will listen for), and
.B service
directives (they affect only a specific group of requests).
.SH "GLOBAL DIRECTIVES"
Global directives may appear anywhere within the configuration file, though it is
customary for them to be at the start. They may appear in any order.
.TP
\fBUser\fR "user_name"
Specify the user
.B zproxy
will run as (must be defined in \fI/etc/passwd\fR).
.TP
\fBGroup\fR "group_name"
Specify the group
.B zproxy
will run as (must be defined in \fI/etc/group\fR).
.TP
\fBName\fR SortName
Specify a Sort name without blank spaces for the Process, this information will shown in logs
.TP
\fBDaemon\fR 0|1
Have
.B zproxy
run in the foreground (if 0) or as a daemon (if 1). By default
.B zproxy
runs as a daemon (detaches itself from the controlling terminal and
puts itself in the background). By specifying this option you can force
.B zproxy
to work like a regular process. Useful for debugging or if you want to
use something like \fIdaemontools\fR.
.TP
\fBThreads\fR nnn
How many Thread workers
.B zproxy
should use, (default: automatic). Default to system concurrency level see nproc command.
.TP
\fBLogFacility\fR value
Specify the log facility to use.
.I value
(default: daemon) must be one of the symbolic facility names defined in
\fIsyslog.h\fR. This facility shall be used for logging. Using a - for
the facility name causes
.B zproxy
to log to stdout/stderr.
.TP
\fBDHParams\fR "path/to/dhparams.pem"
Use the supplied dhparams pem file for DH key exchange for non-export-controlled
negotiations.  Generate such a file with \fBopenssl dhparam\fR.
This can be used to do 2048bit DHE.
.TP
\fBLogLevel\fR value
Specify the logging level following the scheme:
.IP
.I 0-2
No logs
.IP
.I 3
Break points: Something was bad and the binary is going to exit. Parsing configuration file, segfault...
.IP
.I 4
Alerts: WAF logs and backend events (dead/resurrect).
.IP
.I 5
Errors: HTTP issues, connection issues, timeouts.
.IP
.I 6
Info: HTTP transaction summary: stream id, service, client, backend, request host, request line...
.IP
.I 7
Debug: Higher log level, it is useful to trace issues.
.TP
\fBIgnoreCase\fR 0|1
Ignore case when matching URLs (default: 0). This value can be
overridden for specific services.
.TP
\fBCompressionAlgorithm\fR gzip|deflate
Specify the compression algorithm to use. If the client supports it and the
response from the backend is not already compressed, zproxy applies the
compression.
.TP
\fBAlive\fR value
Specify how often
.B zproxy
will check for resurected back-end hosts (default: 30 seconds). In
general, it is a good idea to set this as low as possible - it
will find resurected hosts faster. However, if you set it too
low it will consume resources - so beware.
.TP
\fBClient\fR value
Specify for how long
.B zproxy
will wait for a client request (default: 10 seconds). After this
long has passed without the client sending any data
.B zproxy
will close the connection. Set it higher if your clients
time-out on a slow network or over-loaded server, lower if you
start getting DOS attacks or run into problems with IE clients.
This value can be overridden for specific listeners.
.TP
\fBTimeOut\fR value
How long should
.B zproxy
wait for a response from the back-end (in seconds). Default: 15 seconds.
This value can be overridden for specific back-ends.
.TP
\fBConnTO\fR value
How long should
.B zproxy
wait for a connection to the back-end (in seconds). Default: the
.B TimeOut
value. This value can be overridden for specific back-ends.
.TP
\fBGrace\fR value
How long should
.B zproxy
continue to answer existing connections after a receiving and INT or HUP
signal (default: 30 seconds). The configured listeners are closed
immediately. You can bypass this behaviour by stopping
.B zproxy
with a TERM or QUIT signal, in which case the program exits without any
delay.
.TP
\fBSSLEngine\fR "name"
Use an OpenSSL hardware acceleration card called \fIname\fR. Available
only if OpenSSL-engine is installed on your system.
.TP
\fBECDHcurve\fR "name"
Use for listener the named curve for elliptical curve encryption (default: automatic).
.TP
\fBControl\fR "/path/to/socket"
Set the control socket path. If not defined
.B zproxy
does not listen for any commands. The commands may be issued by using
the
.I zproxyctl(8)
program.
.TP
\fBControlIP \fR   IP
Set the control IP. If not defined
.B zproxy
does not listen for any commands. The commands may be issued by using
the
.I zproxyctl(8)
program.
.TP
\fBControlPort \fR port
Set the control port. If not defines
.B zproxy
does not listen for any commands. The commands may be issued by using
.I zproxyctl(8)
program.
.SH "HTTP Listener"
An HTTP listener defines an address and port that
.B zproxy
will listen on for HTTP requests. All configuration directives enclosed
between
.I ListenHTTP
and
.I End
are specific to a single HTTP listener. At the very least you must specify
and address and a port for each listener. The following directives are
available:
.TP
\fBAddress\fR address
The address that
.B zproxy
will listen on. This can be a numeric IP address, or a symbolic host name
that must be resolvable at run-time.  This is a
.B mandatory
parameter. The address 0.0.0.0 may be used as an alias for 'all available
addresses on this machine', but this practice is strongly discouraged, as
it will interfere with the rewriting mechanisms (see below).
.TP
\fBPort\fR port
The port number that
.B zproxy
will listen on.  This is a
.B mandatory
parameter.
.TP
\fBName\fR name
Listener identifier. It is used mostly to maintain the listener status after a reload.
.TP
\fBxHTTP\fR value
Defines which HTTP verbs are accepted. The possible values are:
.IP
.I 0
(default) accept only standard HTTP requests (GET, POST, HEAD).
.IP
.I 1
additionally allow extended HTTP requests (PUT, PATCH, DELETE).
.IP
.I 2
additionally allow standard WebDAV verbs (LOCK, UNLOCK, PROPFIND,
PROPPATCH, SEARCH, MKCOL, MOVE, COPY, OPTIONS, TRACE, MKACTIVITY,
CHECKOUT, MERGE, REPORT).
.IP
.I 3
additionally allow MS extensions WebDAV verbs (SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE,
NOTIFY, BPROPFIND, BPROPPATCH, POLL, BMOVE, BCOPY, BDELETE, CONNECT).
.IP
.I 4
additionally allow MS RPC extensions verbs (RPC_IN_DATA, RPC_OUT_DATA).
.IP
.I 5
API REST standard: GET, POST, HEAD, PUT, PATCH, DELETE and OPTIONS
.TP
\fBClient\fR value
Override the global
.I Client
time-out value.
.TP
\fBCheckURL\fR "pattern to match"
Define a pattern that must be matched by each request sent to this
listener. A request that does not match is considered to be illegal.
By default
.B zproxy
accepts all requests (i.e. the pattern is ".*"), but you are free to
limit it to something more reasonable. Please note that this applies
only to the request path -
.B zproxy
will still check that the request is syntactically correct.
.TP
\fBErrWAF\fR "filename"
A file with the text to be displayed if the WAF reject a request.
Default: "The request was rejected by the server.".
.TP
\fBErr414\fR "filename"
A file with the text to be displayed if an Error 414 occurs.
Default: "Request URI is too long.".
.TP
\fBErr500\fR "filename"
A file with the text to be displayed if an Error 500 occurs.
Default: "An internal server error occurred. Please try again later.".
.TP
\fBErr501\fR "filename"
A file with the text to be displayed if an Error 501 occurs.
Default: "This method may not be used.".
.TP
\fBErr503\fR "filename"
A file with the text to be displayed if an Error 503 occurs.
Default: "The service is not available. Please try again later.".
.TP
\fBErrNoSsl\fR [code] "filename"
A file with the text to be displayed if a user connects to a HTTPS listener with HTTP. Default: "Please use HTTPS.".
.br
The optional parameter "code" is the HTTP response code, it expects an 4xx or 5xx value. Default: "400".
.br
Only valid for HTTPS listeners.
.TP
\fBNoSslRedirect\fR [code] "url"
A url that the user will be redirected to if the user connects to a HTTPS listener with HTTP.
.br
The code here is just like the code in Redirect blocks. It defaults to 302, but could be 301 or 307.
.br
Only valid for HTTPS listeners.
.br
Example:
.IP
.br
NoSslRedirect "https://thishost:port"
.TP
\fBMaxRequest\fR nnn
Request maximal size. It limits the total request header length, this includes request line (HTTP verb, HTTP URL and HTTP version), the sum of headers and the CLRN characters to end each header.
If a request contains more data than allowed an error 414 is returned.
If MaxRequest is not defined, it is "unlimited", but really it has a size of 64KB which is the connection buffer size. This value cannot be modified and it is set in compilation time.
.TP
\fBAddRequestHeader\fR "header: to add"
Add the defined header to the request passed to the back-end server. The header
is added verbatim. Use multiple \fIAddRequestHeader\fR directives if you need to add more
than one header.
.TP
\fBRemoveRequestHeader\fR "header pattern"
Remove certain headers from the incoming requests. All occurences of the
matching specified header will be removed. Please note that this filtering
is done prior to other checks (such as \fIHeadRequire\fR or \fIHeadDeny\fR),
so you should not try to check for these headers in later matches. Multiple
directives may be specified in order to remove more than one header, and
the header itself may be a regular pattern (though this should be used with
caution).
.TP
\fBAddResponseHeader\fR "header: to add"
Add the defined header to the response passed to the clients. The header
is added verbatim. Use multiple \fIAddResponseHeader\fR directives if you need to add more
than one header.
.TP
\fBRemoveResponseHeader\fR "header pattern"
Remove certain headers from the outcomming response, the header sent by the
backend is not sent to the client. All occurences of the
matching specified header will be removed. Multiple directives may be specified
in order to remove more than one header, and the header itself may be a regular
pattern (though this should be used with caution).
.TP
\fBReplaceHeader\fR <Request|Response> <header-name-regex> <header-value-match> <formated-value-replace>
Replace a header in request or response. If several regex matches in the header, only the first one will apply.
The replaceHeader directive in the services has priority over the listener one.
.br
Example:
           ReplaceHeader    Request     ^Cookie:        ^Server=(.*) 	Test=$1
           ReplaceHeader	Response	^X-Powered-By: 	(.*)	        Server($1)
.TP
\fBRewriteLocation\fR 0|1|2 [path]
This directive changes the Location and Content-Location headers in the responses to show the virtual host that was sent in the request. This directive can be defined in a service in order to overwrite the listener value. It can apply the rewrite in two modes:
.br
.B 	Backend.
The rewrite is applied if the location header points to the backend itself. This is useful to mask and hide the backend address.
.br
.B 	Listener.
It rewrites the header if it points to the listener but with  the  wrong  protocol. It is useful for redirecting a request to an HTTPS listener on the same server as the HTTP listener.
.br
The value 0 disables this directive.
.br
The value 1 (by default) enables the backend and listener rewrites.
.br
The value 2 only enables the backend rewrites.
.br
.I Note:
if the URL location contains a hostname, should be able to resolve it or the rewrite will be skipped.
.br
The path applies if the
.B RewriteUrl
directive modified the request URL. This flag forces to revert the URL transformation that RewriteUrl did. Example: if rewrite modified `/svc1/app` to `/svc2/app`, if the response location header is `/svc2/app` will be replaced to `/svc1/app`
.TP
\fBRewriteDestination\fR 0|1
If 1 force
.B zproxy
to change the Destination: header in requests. The header is changed to point
to the back-end itself with the correct protocol. Default: 0.
.TP
\fBRewriteHost\fR 0|1
If 1 force
.B zproxy
to change the Host: header in requests. The header is changed to point to the
back-end itself using the IP and port (Example: 192.168.200.50:80). Default: 0.
.TP
\fBWafRules\fR "file path"
Apply a WAF ruleset file to the listener. It is possible to add several directives
of this type. Those will be analyzed sequentially, in the same order that they appear
in the configuration file. The rule file must be compatibility with the Modsecurity
syntax (SecLang).
.TP
\fBService\fR "name"
This  defines a private service (see below for service definition syntax). This service will be used only by this listener.
.SH "HTTPS Listener"
An HTTPS listener defines an address and port that
.B zproxy
will listen on for HTTPS requests. All configuration directives enclosed
between
.I ListenHTTPS
and
.I End
are specific to a single HTTPS listener. At the very least you must specify
and address, a port and a server certificate for each listener. All directives
defined for HTTP listeners are applicable to HTTPS listeners as well. The
following additional directives are also available:
.TP
\fBSSLConfigFile\fR "ssl config file"
Specify the OpenSSL configuration file. This file must follow the OpenSSL .cnf file
format. Here is an example of an openSSL configuration file.

    zproxy = test_sect

    [ test_sect ]
    ssl_conf = start_point

    [ start_point ]
    lis = listener

    [ listener ]
    RSA.Certificate = /path/to/your/cert.pem
.TP
\fBSSLConfigSection\fB  section
Specify the OpenSSL configuration section. This section must be in the OpenSSL
configuration file specified before.
.TP
\fBCert\fR "certificate file"
Specify the server certificate. The
.I certificate file
is the file containing the certificate, possibly a certificate chain and the signature
for this server. This directive or the
.I CertDir
directive is
.B mandatory
for HTTPS listeners.
.IP
Please note that multiple
.I Cert
or
.I CertDir
directives are allowed if your OpenSSL version supports SNI. In such cases,
the first directive is the default certificate, with additional certificates
used if the client requests them.
.IP
The ordering of the directives is important: the first certificate where the CN
matches the client request will be used, so put your directives in the
most-specific-to-least specific order (i.e. wildcard certificates
.B after
host-specific certificates).
.IP
.I Cert
and
.I CertDir
directives
.B must
precede all other SSL-specific directives.
.TP
\fBCertDir\fR "certificate directory"
Specify the server certificate or certificates. The
.I certificate directory
is a directory path containing one or more certificates, possibly a certificate chain and the signature
for this server. This directive or
.I Cert
is
.B mandatory
for HTTPS listeners.
.IP
If a wildcard is specified, it will be honored.  Otherwise all files will be loaded from that directory.
For example, "/etc/certs/*.pem" will load all files from that directory that match the file extension given.
.IP
Please note that multiple
.I Cert
or
.I CertDir
directives are allowed if your OpenSSL version supports SNI. In such cases,
the first directive is the default certificate, with additional certificates
used if the client requests them.
.IP
The filenames in the directory will be sorted before being loaded. The order of files
is important: the first certificate where the CN
matches the client request will be used, so sort your files in the
most-specific-to-least specific order (i.e. wildcard certificates
.B after
host-specific certificates).
.IP
.I Cert
and
.I CertDir
directives
.B must
precede all other SSL-specific directives.
.TP
\fBDisable\fR SSLv2|SSLv3|TLSv1|TLSv1_1|TLSv1_2|TLSv1_3
Disable the protocol \fBand all lower protocols as well\fR.
This is due to a limitation in OpenSSL, which does not support disabling a single
protocol. For example,
.I Disable TLSv1
would disable SSLv2, SSLv3 and TLSv1, thus allowing only TLSv1_1 and TLSv1_2.
.I [NOTE]Disable TLSv1_3
would disable only TLSv1_3.
.TP
\fBECDHcurve\fR "name"
Use the named curve for elliptical curve encryption (default: automatic), overwrite global ECDHcurve.
.TP
\fBCiphers\fR "acceptable:cipher:list"
This is the list of ciphers that will be accepted by the SSL connection; it is a
string in the same format as in OpenSSL
.I ciphers(1)
and
.I SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list(3).
.TP
\fBSSLHonorCipherOrder\fR 0|1
If this value is 1, the server will broadcast a preference to use \fBCiphers\fR in
the order supplied in the \fBCiphers\fR directive.  If the value is 0, the server
will treat the Ciphers list as the list of Ciphers it will accept, but no preference
will be indicated.  Default value is 0.
.TP
\fBSSLAllowClientRenegotiation\fR 0|1|2
If this value is 0, client initiated renegotiation will be disabled.  This will
mitigate DoS exploits based on client renegotiation, regardless of the patch status
of clients and servers related to "Secure renegotiation".  If the value is 1, secure
renegotiation is supported.  If the value is 2, insecure renegotiation is supported,
with unpatched clients. \fBThis can lead to a DoS and a Man in the Middle attack!\fR
The default value is 0.
.TP
\fBCAlist\fR "CAcert_file"
Set the list of "trusted" CA's for this server. The CAcert_file is a file containing
a sequence of CA certificates (PEM format). The names of the defined CA certificates
will be sent to the client on connection.
.TP
\fBVerifyList\fR "Verify_file"
Set the CA (Certificate Authority). The Verify_file is a file that contains the CA
root certificates (in PEM format).
.IP
.IR "Please note":
there is an important difference between the CAlist and the VerifyList. The
CAlist tells the client (browser) which client certificates it should send. The
VerifyList defines which CAs are actually used for the verification of the
returned certificate.
.TP
\fBCRLlist\fR "CRL_file"
Set the CRL (Certificate Revocation List) file. The CRL_file is a file that contains
the CRLs (in PEM format).
.TP
\fBForwardSNI\fR "0|1 default=1"
Enable SNI server host name forwarding to https backends if it presented by client.
.SH "Service"
A service is a definition of which back-end servers
.B zproxy
will use to reply to incoming requests. A service may be defined as part
of a listener (in which case it will be used only by that listener), or
globally (which makes it available to all listeners).
.B zproxy
will always try the private services in the order defined, followed by
the global ones.
.P
All configuration directives enclosed between
.I Service
and
.I End
are specific to a single service. The following directives are available:
.TP
\fBURL\fR "pattern"
Match the incoming request. If a request fails to match than this service
will be skipped and next one tried. If all services fail to match
.B zproxy
returns an error. You may define multiple
.I URL
conditions per service, in which case
.B all
patterns must match. If no
.I URL
was defined then all requests match. The matching is by default case-sensitive,
but this can be overridden by specifying
.B IgnoreCase 1
.TP
\fBOrURLs\fR
Defines a block of
.I URL
directives that should be merged into a single pattern, all OR'd together.
This creates a pattern like
.B ((url1)|(url2)|(url3))
 for as many
.I URL
directives as are specified within the block.  End the block with an
.I End
directive.
.TP
\fBRewriteUrl\fR "pattern" "replace" [last]
It checks a pattern in order to get strings from URL and replace them.
Several RewriteUrl directives can be added. All of them will be sequentially applied to the incoming URL unless the *last* flag is set that will finish the rewrite url phase.
.br
              Examples: if you specified
.br
                  RewriteUrl "/media/(.+)$" "/svc1/$1" last
                  RewriteUrl "^(.*)$" "/sub-default$1"
.br
A regex will be applied only once per directive, I.E, the directive `RewriteUrl "/param" "/p"` for the URL `/param/1/param/2` will produce `/p/1/param/2`.
.TP
\fBRewriteLocation\fR 0|1|2 [path]
This directive changes the Location and Content-Location headers in the responses to show the virtual host that was sent in the request. This directive can be defined in a service in order to overwrite the listener value. It can apply the rewrite in two modes:
.br
.B 	Backend.
The rewrite is applied if the location header points to the backend itself. This is useful to mask and hide the backend address.
.br
.B 	Listener.
It rewrites the header if it points to the listener but with  the  wrong  protocol. It is useful for redirecting a request to an HTTPS listener on the same server as the HTTP listener.
.br
The value 0 disables this directive.
.br
The value 1 (by default) enables the backend and listener rewrites.
.br
The value 2 only enables the backend rewrites.
.br
.I Note:
if the URL location contains a hostname, should be able to resolve it or the rewrite will be skipped.
.br
The path applies if the
.B RewriteUrl
directive modified the request URL. This flag forces to revert the URL transformation that RewriteUrl did. Example: if rewrite modified `/svc1/app` to `/svc2/app`, if the response location header is `/svc2/app` will be replaced to `/svc1/app`
.TP
\fBIgnoreCase\fR 0|1
Override the global
.B IgnoreCase
setting.
.TP
\fBHeadRequire\fR "pattern"
The request must contain at least on header matching the given pattern.
Multiple
.I HeadRequire
directives may be defined per service, in which case all of them must
be satisfied.
.TP
\fBHeadDeny\fR "pattern"
The request may
.B not
contain any header matching the given pattern.  Multiple
.I HeadDeny
directives may be defined per service, in which case all of them must be satisfied.
.IP
.IR "Please note":
if the listener defined a
.I HeadRemove
directive, the matching headers are removed
.B before
the service matching is attempted.
.TP
\fBAddRequestHeader\fR "header: to add"
This directive overwrites the listener
.I AdddrequestHeader.
Add the defined header to the request passed to the back-end server. The header
is added verbatim. Use multiple \fIAddRequestHeader\fR directives if you need to add more
than one header.
.TP
\fBRemoveRequestHeader\fR "header pattern"
This directive overwrites the listener
.I AdddrequestHeader.
Remove certain headers from the incoming requests. All occurences of the
matching specified header will be removed. Please note that this filtering
is done prior to other checks (such as \fIHeadRequire\fR or \fIHeadDeny\fR),
so you should not try to check for these headers in later matches. Multiple
directives may be specified in order to remove more than one header, and
the header itself may be a regular pattern (though this should be used with
caution).
.TP
\fBAddResponseHeader\fR "header: to add"
This directive overwrites the listener
.I AdddrequestHeader.
Add the defined header to the response passed to the clients. The header
is added verbatim. Use multiple \fIAddResponseHeader\fR directives if you need to add more
than one header.
.TP
\fBRemoveResponseHeader\fR "header pattern"
This directive overwrites the listener
.I AdddrequestHeader.
Remove certain headers from the outcomming response, the header sent by the
backend is not sent to the client. All occurences of the
matching specified header will be removed. Multiple directives may be specified
in order to remove more than one header, and the header itself may be a regular
pattern (though this should be used with caution).
.TP
\fBReplaceHeader\fR <Request|Response> "<header-name-regex>" "<header-value-match>" "<formated-value-replace>"
Replace a header in request or response. If several regex matches in the header, only the first one will apply.
The replaceHeader directive in the services has priority over the listener one.
.br
Example:
           ReplaceHeader    Request     ^Cookie:        ^Server=(.*) 	Test=$1
           ReplaceHeader	Response	^X-Powered-By: 	(.*)	        Server($1)
.TP
\fBRoutingPolicy\fR ROUND_ROBIN|LEAST_CONNECTIONS|RESPONSE_TIME
Specify the routing policy. All the algorithms are weighted with all the
weights set in each backend.

    \fBROUND_ROBIN\fR use the round robin algorithm as a routing policy (used by default).

    \fBLEAST_CONNECTIONS\fR select the backend with least connections established
    using as a proportion the weights set.

    \fBRESPONSE_TIME\fR select the backend with the lowest response time using
    as a proportion the weights set.

.TP
\fBBackEnd\fR
Directives enclosed between a
.I BackEnd
and
the following
.I End
directives define a single back-end server (see below for details). You may define
multiple back-ends per service, in which case
.B zproxy
will attempt to load-balance between them.
.TP
\fB[Redirect | RedirectAppend | RedirectDynamic]\fR [code] "url"
This is a special type of back-end. Instead of sending the request to a back-end
.B zproxy
replies immediately with a redirection to the given URL. You may define multiple
redirectors in a service, as well as mixing them with regular back-ends.
.IP
The address the client is redirected to is determined by the command you specify.
If you specify \fBRedirect\fR, the url is taken as an absolute host and path
to redirect to.  If you use \fBRedirectAppend\fR, the original request path
will be appended to the host and path you specified.  If you use \fBRedirectDynamic\fR,
then
.I url
can contain RegEx replacements in the form
.I $1
through
.I $9
which indicate expression captured from the original request path. You must have a
\fBURL\fR directive, and the first \fBURL\fR directive for the service is the one
used for capturing expressions.
.IP
Examples: if you specified
.br

.br
    Redirect "http://abc.example"
.br

.br
and the client requested
.I http://xyz/a/b/c
then it will be redirected to
.IR "http://abc.example",
but if you specified
.br

.br
    RedirectAppend "http://abc.example"
.br

.br
it will be sent to
.IR "http://abc.example/a/b/c.
.IP
If you specified
.br
    URL "^/a(/([^/]*)(/[^/]*)"
.br
    RedirectDynamic "http://abc.example$2$1/index.html"
.br

.br
it will be sent to
.IR "http://abc.example/c/b/index.html.
.IP
.IR "Technical note":
in an ideal world
.B zproxy
should reply with a "307 Temporary Redirect" status. Unfortunately, that is not
yet supported by all clients (in particular HTTP 1.0 ones), so
.B zproxy
currently replies by default with a "302 Found" instead. You may override this
behaviour by specifying the code to be used (301, 302 or 307).
.TP
\fBSession\fR
Directives enclosed between a
.I Session
and
the following
.I End
directives define a session-tracking mechanism for the current service. See below
for details.
.SH "BackEnd"
A back-end is a definition of a single back-end server
.B zproxy
will use to reply to incoming requests.  All configuration directives enclosed between
.I BackEnd
and
.I End
are specific to a single service. The following directives are available:
.TP
\fBAddress\fR address
The address that
.B zproxy
will connect to. This can be a numeric IP address, or a symbolic host name
that must be resolvable at run-time. If the name cannot be resolved to a valid
address,
.B zproxy
will assume that it represents the path for a Unix-domain socket. This is a
.B mandatory
parameter.
.TP
\fBPort\fR port
The port number that
.B zproxy
will connect to. This is a
.B mandatory
parameter for non Unix-domain back-ends.
.TP
\fBHTTPS\fR
The back-end is using HTTPS.
.TP
\fBCert\fR "certificate file"
Specify the certificate that
.B zproxy
will use as a client. The
.I certificate file
is the file containing the certificate, possibly a certificate chain and the signature.
This directive may appear only after the
.I HTTPS
directive.
.TP
\fBDisable\fR SSLv2|SSLv3|TLSv1|TLSv1_1|TLSv1_2|TLSv1_3
Disable the protocol \fBand all lower protocols as well\fR.
This is due to a limitation in OpenSSL, which does not support disabling a single
protocol. For example,
.I Disable TLSv1
would disable SSLv2, SSLv3 and TLSv1, thus allowing only TLSv1_1 and TLSv1_2.
.I [NOTE]Disable TLSv1_3
would disable only TLSv1_3.
.I HTTPS
directive.
.TP
\fBECDHcurve\fR "name"
Use the named curve for elliptical curve encryption (default: automatic).
.TP
\fBCiphers\fR "acceptable:cipher:list"
This is the list of ciphers that will be accepted by the SSL connection; it is a
string in the same format as in OpenSSL
.I ciphers(1)
and
.I SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list(3).
This directive may appear only after the
.I HTTPS
directive.
.TP
\fBWeight\fR val
The weight of this back-end (between 1 and 9, 5 is default). Higher weight
back-ends will be used more often than lower weight ones, so you should
define higher weights for more capable servers.
.TP
\fBPriority\fR val
The priority value for the current real server, lower values are more priority.
The default service priority value is 1. When a backend fails in the pool the
service priority is increased by 1, and when the backend is alive again the
service priority value is decreased by 1. Active backends contains priority
values less than or equal to the service priority.
.TP
\fBConnLimit\fR val
The maximum number of established connection per backend. With a value of 0, there
will not be a limit in the backend. The client will receive a 503 error if there aren't
available backends.
.TP
\fBTimeOut\fR val
Override the global
.I TimeOut
value.
.TP
\fBConnTO\fR val
Override the global
.I ConnTO
value.
.TP
\fBKey\fR "key"
The key associated to this backend, if using BackendCookie in the service.  If
left blank, it'll be autogenerated from the backend address.
.TP
\fBNfmark\fR val
Allow to mark all the
.B zproxy
back-end connections in order to track them and allow to the Kernel
network stack to manage them. (Decimal format)
.SH "Session"
Defines how a service deals with possible HTTP sessions.  All configuration
directives enclosed between
.I Session
and
.I End
are specific to a single service. Once a sessions is identified,
.B zproxy
will attempt to send all requests within that session to the same back-end
server.
.PP
The following directives are available:
.TP
\fBType\fR IP|BASIC|URL|PARM|COOKIE|HEADER
What kind of sessions are we looking for: IP (the client address), BASIC (basic
authentication), URL (a request parameter), PARM (a URI parameter), COOKIE (a
certain cookie), or HEADER (a certain request header).
This is a
.B mandatory
parameter.
.TP
\fBTTL\fR seconds
How long can a session be idle (in seconds). A session that has been idle for
longer than the specified number of seconds will be discarded.
This is a
.B mandatory
parameter.
.TP
\fBID\fR "name"
The session identifier. This directive is permitted only for sessions of type
URL (the name of the request parameter we need to track), COOKIE (the name of
the cookie) and HEADER (the header name).
.TP
\fBPath\fR "path_domain"
This parameter should be used only for BACKENDCOOKIE session. It is the path value in the cookie header.
.TP
\fBDomain\fR "cookie_domain"
This parameter should be used only for BACKENDCOOKIE session. It is the domain value in the cookie header.
.PP
See below for some examples.
.SH HIGH-AVAILABILITY
.B zproxy
attempts to keep track of active back-end servers, and will temporarily disable
servers that do not respond (though not necessarily dead: an overloaded server
that
.B zproxy
cannot establish a connection to will be considered dead). However, every
.I Alive
seconds, an attempt is made to connect to the dead servers in case they have become
active again. If this attempt succeeds, connections will be initiated to them again.
.PP
In general it is a good idea to set this time interval as low as is consistent with
your resources in order to benefit from resurected servers at the earliest possible
time. The default value of 30 seconds is probably a good choice.
.PP
The clients that happen upon a dead back-end server will just receive a
.I "503 Service Unavailable"
message.
.PP
The
.I HAport
parameter specifies an additional port (and optionally an address)
that is used only for viability checks: if this port is specified in a
.I BackEnd
directive,
.B zproxy
will attempt periodically (every
.I Alive
seconds) to connect to this port. If the port does not respond the server is considered dead.
.B "It never makes sense to have the"
.I HAport
.B "identical to the main back-end port:"
this would only generate extra, unncecessary activity (CPU, network traffic) for no good
reason whatsoever.  The
.I HAport
is meant for applications that offer an additional health monitoring port or for installations
that wish to take servers off-line in a controlled manner.
.PP
By default the address of the
.I HAport
health monitor is the same as that of the
back-end server. You may specify a different address though, for example if you have
a monitoring program running on another host.

.SH HTTPS HEADERS
If a client browser connects to
.B zproxy
via HTTPS and if it presents a client certificate
.B zproxy
adds the following headers to the request it issues to the server:
.TP
\fBX-SSL-Subject\fR
Details about the certificate owner.
.TP
\fBX-SSL-Issuer\fR
Details about the certificate issuer (Certificate Authority).
.TP
\fBX-SSL-notBefore\fR
Starting date of certificate validity.
.TP
\fBX-SSL-notAfter\fR
Ending date of certificate validity.
.TP
\fBX-SSL-serial\fR
Certificate serial number (decimal).
.TP
\fBX-SSL-cipher\fR
The cipher currently in use.
.TP
\fBX-SSL-certificate\fR
The full client certificate (PEM-format multi-line)
.PP
It is the application's responsibility to actually use these
headers - zproxy just passes this information without checking
it in any way (except for signature and encryption correctness).
.SH SECURITY
.PP
In general,
.B zproxy
does not read or write to the hard-disk. The exceptions are reading the configuration file
and (possibly) the server certificate file(s) and error message(s), which are opened read-only
on startup, read,
and closed, and the pid file which is opened on start-up, written to and immediately closed.
Following this there is no disk access whatsoever, so using a RootJail directive is only
for extra security bonus points.
.PP
.B zproxy
tries to sanitise all HTTP/HTTPS requests: the request itself, the headers and the contents
are checked for conformance to the RFC's and only valid requests are passed to the back-end
servers. This is not absolutely fool-proof - as the recent Apache problem with chunked
transfers demonstrated. However, given the current standards, this is the best that can
be done - HTTP is an inherently weak protocol.
.SH ADDITIONAL NOTES
.B zproxy
uses the system log for messages (default facility LOG_DAEMON). The format is very similar to
other web servers, so that if you want to use a log tool:
.TP
    fgrep zproxy /var/log/messages | your_log_tool
.PP
.B zproxy
deals with (and sanitizes) HTTP/1.1 requests. Thus even if you have an HTTP/1.0 server,
a single connection to an HTTP/1.1 client is kept, while the connection to the back-end
server is re-opened as necessary.
.PP
.B zproxy
attempts to resolve the names of the hosts that appear in various requests and/or responses.
That means it need a functioning resolver of some kind (be it /etc/hosts, DNS or something
else).
.SH EXAMPLES

Here is a more complex example: assume your static images (GIF/JPEG) are to be served
from a single back-end 192.168.0.10. In addition, 192.168.0.11 is to do the
hosting for www.myserver.com with URL-based sessions, and 192.168.0.20 (a 1GHz PIII)
and 192.168.0.21 (800Mhz Duron) are for all other requests (cookie-based sessions).
The logging will be done by the back-end servers.  The configuration file may look like this:
