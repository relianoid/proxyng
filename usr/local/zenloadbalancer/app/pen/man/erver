       penctl lbhost:8888 roundrobin

       Turns off client tracking on the load balancer running on lbhost.


DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _P_e_n_c_t_l connects to the optional control socket on a pen load balancer.  It reads commands from the command
       line, performs minimal syntax checking and sends them to pen. Replies, if any, are printed on stdout.

       The program can also be used through the cgi script penctl.cgi, which allows pen to be controlled from any
       web browser.


OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _h_o_s_t_:_p_o_r_t
              Specifies a control port where the load balancer listens for commands.

              Adds  an entry to access list N, where N is a number from 0 to 9. The source and mask addresses are
              in the usual dotted quad notation. If mask is omitted, it defaults to 255.255.255.255.

       _n_o _a_c_l _N
              Deletes all entries from access list N. The resulting access list permits all traffic.

              that immediately.

              Try  to  forward  data  immediately,  to avoid the overhead of copying it to a temporary buffer and
              waiting for the next main loop round.
